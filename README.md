# Towards Unravelling Transcriptomic Changes In Human Airway Smooth Muscles 

## Abstract (2): 

Asthma used to be a chronic inflammatory airway disease which can be treated by and glucocorticosteroids and Î²2-agonists. Airway smooth muscle is one of the targeted primary tissues for treatment . An Experiment was performed for retrieving RNA-Seq in order to characterize the human airway smooth muscle (HASM) transcriptome at baseline and under three asthma treatment conditions [2]. In our analysis, Two conditions only were used Differential expression analysis for Airway smooth muscle tissues first at baseline and secondly at treatment with glucocorticoids will be performed to identify the differentially expressed genes in order to characterize transcriptomic changes in human ASM cell lines that were treated with dexamethasone a potent synthetic glucocorticoid and without treatment.
